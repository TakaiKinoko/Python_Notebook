## Lexical Structure
* Notes from Python in a Nutshell, 3rd Edition.
* lowest-level syntax of the language

### lines and indentation
* a python prog is a sequence of **logical lines** each made up of one or more **physi‚Äê cal lines**
* **comment** # that is not inside a string literal starts a comment
* **no delimiter**. when a stmt is too long for one physical line, join two adjacent physical lines into a logical line by ensuring that the first physical line has no comment and ends with a backslash \
* auto join: adjacent physical lines are joint into one logical line if an open parenthesis ((), bracket ([), or brace ({) has not yet been closed. 
* **blocks** indentation is the only way to denote blocks. *A block is a contiguous sequence of logical lines, all indented by the same amount; a logical line with less indentation ends the block.*
* Standard Python style is to use **four spaces** (never tabs) per indentation level.


### character sets
v3 source: Unicode character, encoded as UTF-8
* In both v2 and v3, you may choose to tell Python that a certain source file is written in a different encoding
* To let Python know that a source file is written with a nonstandard encoding, start your source file with **a comment** whose form must be, for example:
    * 
    ```
    # coding: iso-8859-1
    ```
* the above **coding directive comment** (also known as an encoding declaration) is taken as such only if it is at the start of a source file

### tokens
* Each token corresponds to a substring of the logical line. 
* The normal token types are 
    1. identifiers 
    1. keywords 
    1. operators 
    1. delimiters
    1. literals

#### identifiers
* 
    *  starts with a letter (in v2, A to Z or a to z; in v3, other characters that Unicode classifies as letters are also allowed) or an underscore (_)
    * followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (in v2, 0 to 9; in v3, other characters that Unicode classifies as digits or combining marks are also allowed
    * Punctuation characters such as @, $, and ! are **not allowed** in identifiers.
* **Python conventions**:
    * class name: start with cap
    * other ids: start with lower case 
    * 
        ```
        _someName   # this id is meant to be private
        ```
    * 
        ```
        __someName  # this is a strongly private identifier
        ```
    * 
        ```
        __someName__  # this is a language-defined special name
        ```

#### keywords
* v2: 31
* v3: 33
* Keywords contain lowercase letters only
* Reserved for special syntactic uses
* keywords may mark the beginning of a simple stmt or a clause of a compound stmt, or serve as operators

#### operators
* use nonalphanumeric characters and character combinations as operators
```
+ - * / % ** // << >> & | ^ ~ < <= > >= <> != ==
```

#### delimiters
```
(  )  [  ]  {  }   ,  :  .  `  =  ;  @
```

augmented assignment operators, which are delimiters, but also perform operations:
```
+=  -=  *=  /=  //=  %=  &=  |=  ^=  >>=  <<=  **=
```

surround string literals:
```
' and "
```

start a comment: 
```
#
```

joining physical lines into one logical line: 
```
\
```

escape char in string:
```
\
```

#### literals
A literal is the direct denotation in a program of a **data value** (a number, string, or container)

* **base types**
    number and string
    ```
    42      # Int literal
    3.14    # Float literal
    1.0j    # Imaginary literal
    'hello' # String 
    "world" # String
    """ Python """  # Triple-quoted string
    ```
* **compound**
    combine number and string literals with delimiters to build **container type** data values: 
    ```
    []  # empty list
    [1, 3.14, 'hello']  # list
    100, 200, 300       # tuple
    ()      # empty tuple
    {'x': 42, 'y':3.14}     #dict
    {}      # empty dict
    {1, 2, 4, 8, 'string'}      # set
    # there's no literal to denote empty set. Use set() instead.
    ```
