## Lexical Structure
lowest-level syntax of the language

#### lines and indentation
* a python prog is a sequence of **logical lines** each made up of one or more **physi‚Äê cal lines**
* **comment** # that is not inside a string literal starts a comment
* **no delimiter**. when a stmt is too long for one physical line, join two adjacent physical lines into a logical line by ensuring that the first physical line has no comment and ends with a backslash (\)
* auto join: adjacent physical lines are joint into one logical line if an open parenthesis ((), bracket ([), or brace ({) has not yet been closed. 
* **blocks** indentation is the only way to denote blocks. *A block is a contiguous sequence of logical lines, all indented by the same amount; a logical line with less indentation ends the block.*
* Standard Python style is to use **four spaces** (never tabs) per indentation level.
